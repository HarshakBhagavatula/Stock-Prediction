## Overview
This project implements an automated survey analysis solution that preprocesses, analyzes, and visualizes survey data to extract actionable insights.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have all the necessary libraries installed.
2. Place the survey dataset (`survey_results_public.csv`) in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script using the command: `python main.py`

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, normalizes numeric data, and preprocesses text data.
- **Analysis:** Clustering, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling are performed.
- **Visualization:** Key findings are visualized using scatter plots and word clouds.

## Findings
- **Clusters:** Identified five clusters based on numeric survey responses.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Revealed overall sentiment trends in textual responses.
- **Topic Modeling:** Highlighted common themes in the textual responses using LDA.

## Recommendations
- Focus on improving areas identified by negative sentiment.
- Further investigate prominent topics to gain deeper insights.

## Conclusion
This solution provides a scalable and efficient way to analyze diverse survey data, offering valuable insights for decision-making.
